# Data Analysis: Music Taste and Mental Health
I conducted an analysis that focused on exploring various aspects, such as interests in music genres, listening habits, and their respective anxiety, depression, insomnia, and Obstructive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) levels. I then interpreted the impacts of music on these mental health indicators. This dataset, which I obtained from Kaggle, provides valuable insights into the relationships between demographic information, music preferences, and mental well-being. The goal is to unravel patterns and connections within the data. The precise recording of this dataset is crucial for future analyses, seeking to enhance our understanding of the major factors influencing mental health indicators. With this the question of interest that might emerge is: Are there associations between specific music genres and levels of anxiety, depression, insomnia, or OCD? Perhaps, we can predict mental health conditions using music taste. Addressing this type of questions is essential for uncovering the nuanced links between music choices and mental health consequences.
